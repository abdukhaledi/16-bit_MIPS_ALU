# 16-bit_MIPS_ALU
The aim of this project is to build a 16-bit MIPS ALU and Control unit using Logisim-evolution tool for designing and simulating the circuits. We started with designing a 1-bit ALU that performs AND, OR, add, subtract, NOR and set less than operations. Then, we constructed a 16-bit ALU from the 1-bit ALU circuit. After that we built a control unit using R-format, lw, sw, beq instructions, and addi.
